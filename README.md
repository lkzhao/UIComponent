# UIComponent

UIComponent is a declarative and modern framework to build user interfaces with UIKit. With the power of `@resultBuilder` and `@dynamicMemberLookup`, your UIKit interface can be easily constructed with a syntax similar to SwiftUI. UIComponent also embraces unidirectional data flow instead of two way binding, and offers great performance and optimization opportunities.
