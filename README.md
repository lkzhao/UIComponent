# UIComponent

UIComponent is a declarative and modern framework to build user interfaces with UIKit/AppKit. With the power of `@resultBuilder` and `@dynamicMemberLookup`, your platform UI can be easily constructed with a syntax similar to SwiftUI. UIComponent also embraces unidirectional data flow instead of two way binding, and offers great performance and optimization opportunities.

In version 5.0, UIComponent can also easily render SwiftUI View alongside platform views and other components.
