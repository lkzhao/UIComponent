# ``UIComponent``

A modern, declarative approach to building user interfaces with UIKit.

## Overview

UIComponent is a declarative and modern framework to build user interfaces with UIKit. With the power of `@resultBuilder` and `@dynamicMemberLookup`, your UIKit UI can be easily constructed with a syntax similar to SwiftUI. 

##### Compare to SwiftUI, UIComponent offers:
* Seamless intergration with UIKit
* Better performance:
    * Global cell reuse
    * Renders only the visible views
    * Supports background layout
* Simple to understand
    * Unidirectional data flow
    * UI only. No state management nor two way binding
    * Open Source
* Support `for-loop` and `switch` statement in the result builder
